Nether concerns
----------------
There are some main routes for the Nether, and they are:
1. Leave nether as is
2. Generate a new nether
3. Hybrid

### Leave nether as is
- Simplest implementation
- Players can go to the nether and get all resources normally available there

### Generate a new nether
- Harder to implement
- Default resources disappear and must be handled somehow
- Could generate a big "nether fortress zone" at the center of the nether
  - This would be a big area with nether fortresses spawn rules
  - The rest of the nether would be a void world
  - This would make finding a nether fortress easier
- Custom spawning solution
  - Spawn nether fortress mobs on certain block types. This is a nice solution
    because it follows the skyblock theme of having to create the environment.
    Players can create farms freely. Players must find netherrack and burn it to bricks.

### Hybrid
- Generate new nether but keep structure and decoration generation
    - Preserves nether fortresses, bastions, etc.
- Finding a nether fortress becomes harder because of the void world.
  - Though in a way it's easier because there is no terrain obscuring it
  
- Some resources still missing, e.g.
  - netherrack
  - quartz
  - etc.
- Could create a mechanic to direct the player towards the nether fortress
  - e.g. compass pointing towards the nearest fortress if the player is in the nether

# Unobtainable resources in empty nether

# ✅ Solved (Fix Implemented)
- Netherrack -> Loot from zombie pigmen
- Blaze rod -> Blaze made spawnable on nether bricks
- Wither skull -> Wither skeleton made spawnable on nether bricks

# ❌ Unsolved (Requires Plugin Fix)
- Ancient debris
- Nether wart
- Nether gold ore
- Nether quartz ore
- Crimson/warped nylium, which leads to fungi, planks, etc
  - What if sculk catalysts are used to grow them?
