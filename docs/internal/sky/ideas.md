# Ideas for exploring

# The end
- Assuming normal nether generation, move stronghold generation to the nether? Unfortunately, Eye of Enders don't work in the nether...
- If void nether, need a way to craft the end portal frame blocks.
    - Make them mineable.
    - Make them craftable with a special recipe.
    - Ingredients should require some effort using the nether/nether materials
      to get the progression order right.

## Lore books from wiki
There could be random drops of books that contain tips and tricks regarding how minecraft works internally
to benefit the player when playing skyblock. These will help the player progress faster and understand
the mechanics of the game better.

# Misc
- Supersapling. A sapling that always places a sapling with half the grow time.
