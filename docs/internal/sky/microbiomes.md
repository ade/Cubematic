# Main world generator
## Microbiomes
In normal/default skyblock, the map can either be created as a superflat world with a single biome,
or as a normal world with normal distribution of biomes but all terrain removed.

To allow the player to explore different biomes, we will add a system of microbiomes.
Small biomes are generated around the player as part of the world generation process supplied by the plugin.
They are are quadratic and have a size of X chunks (TBD).
