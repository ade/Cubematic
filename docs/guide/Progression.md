How to progress in the game

## First days
1. Acquire saplings and plant them to get more wood.
2. You have three game days before phantoms start to spawn.
   - Phantoms only spawn above Y=64 with the sky visible above the player,
     so you can build a roof over your head to prevent them from spawning,
     or build downwards and stay below Y=64 instead.
